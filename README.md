# AcabotJC
A Discord bot for all your all your A Capella group's needs, rewritten with discord.js

This Discord bot was created initially created using Python with the pycord library, but has been rewritten with JavaScript using discord.js. The bot was created for Fredonia's A Capella community Discord servers, but is posted here for public use. You can repurpose this for your own needs if you wish, or utilize it as is by [adding the bot to your Discord server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1341911595441455104).

# Features
## Google Calendar Integration
This bot has commands that can be used to interact with Google Calendar and to create webhooks that will send updates from a calendar to a channel in your server. Webhooks are achieved using Firebase Cloud Functions to listen for HTTP requests from the Google Calendar API. You can also create events and get specific events off the calendar to share with your server members.

## Music
You can use this bot to play music from YouTube while in a voice channel, and you can also utilize the queue system to create a playlist of songs to enjoy with friends.

## Private Channel Creation
This bot allows you to create private channels with the roles of your choosing, perfect for creating a private space to plan out events and gigs with other groups. Since the channels are private, you don't have to worry about others spoiling anything.

## Polls
You can create polls with up to six options using the modern Discord Buttons UI. Restrictions exist so that users cannot vote more than once on a poll.

### More features coming soon.
